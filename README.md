gxRest
----
The gCube eXtensions to the Rest Protocol (gxRest) is a set of Java libraries designed to provide convenient round-trip interaction between a Restful web application (also known as "service") and its clients. 

gxRest has the flexibility for different degrees of exploitation of the library:
* it can be entirely adopted both at client and service side with full benefit of its conventions;
* it can be used just to send REST requests based only on plain HTTP;
* it can be used to parse the HTTP code of a response;
* it can be used only to return HTTP codes from the service.
* it can be used only to return Exceptions from the service.
