gxRest
----
The gCube eXtensions to the Rest Protocol (gxRest) is a set of Java libraries designed to provide convenient round-trip interaction between a Restful web application (also known as "service") and its clients. 

gxRest has the flexibility for different degrees of exploitation:
* it can be entirely adopted both at client and service side with full benefit of its conventions;
* it can be used to send REST requests based only on plain HTTP;
* it can be used only to return HTTP code/messagess from the service;
* it can be used only to throw Exceptions from the service to the client.
