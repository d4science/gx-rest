gxRest
----
The gCube eXtensions to the Rest Protocol (gxRest) is a set of Java libraries designed to provide convenient round-trip interaction between a Restful web application (also known as "service") and its clients. 

gxRest has the flexibility for different degrees of exploitation:
* it can be entirely adopted both at client and service side with full benefit of its conventions;
* it can be used to send REST requests based only on plain HTTP;
* it can be used only to return HTTP code/messagess from the service;
* it can be used only to throw Exceptions from the service to the client.
    
## Examples of use

Sending a request:
```java
GXHTTPRequest request = GXHTTPRequest.newRequest("http://host:port/service/").from("GXRequestTest");
 
//prepare some parameters
String context ="...";
Map<String,String> queryParams = new WeakHashMap<>();
queryParams.put("param name", "param value");
GXInboundResponse response = request.path("context")
	  .queryParams(queryParams).withBody(context).post();

```
   
Returning a success response:   
```java
 @POST
  public Response create(...) {
 
    //Resource successfully created 
    
    URI location = ... //URI of the new resource
    return GXOutboundSuccessResponse.newCREATEResponse(location)
              .withMessage("Resource successfully created.")
	      .ofType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
              .build();
  }
``` 

Throwing an exception:   
```java
@POST
  public Response create(...) {
 
    //Oh no, something failed here
    GXOutboundErrorResponse.throwException(new MyCustomException("Resource already exists."));
    
  }   
``` 


Parsing a response
```java
// invoke the remote method and get a response.
GXInboundResponse response = ...;
if (response.hasException()) 
    throw response.getException();
//assuming a created (200) code was expected 
if (response.hasCREATEDCode()) {
		System.out.println("Resource successfully created!");
}
//access content as string
String value = response.getStreamedContentAsString();
//unmasharll content as json
Context returnedContext = response.tryConvertStreamedContentFromJson(Context.class);
```
